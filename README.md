## 🌟 Highlights & Features

- **3D Procedural BIM Model**: Faithfully recreated in Three.js from Autodesk Revit & Navisworks (`CIVIL DEPARTMENT CEC 01.nwc`), featuring G+2 floors, cream facade with red horizontal band courses, 4 projecting corner towers with top apertures, double window wings, and entrance portico signage.
- **25 Simulated IoT Data Streams**: Live environmental monitoring across 3 floors + MEP systems (Temperature, Humidity, CO2, Occupancy, Energy Load, Noise, and Structural Vibration) updating every 2.5 seconds.
- **AI Anomaly Detection Engine**: Isolation Forest ML simulation flagging real-time indoor air quality (CO2 spikes up to 1600 ppm) and thermal variances.
- **Natural Language AI Query Bar**: Ask questions in plain English (e.g., *"Which floor has highest CO2?"*, *"What is total energy load?"*).
- **Cinematic Glassmorphism UI**: NASA mission-control dark theme (`#040810`), real-time Chart.js energy trend graph, dynamic SVG building health score arc (0–100), alert popups, and scanline overlay.
